# LLM Research Buddy

**My vision:** An LLM-based assistant to help with finding and understanding research papers.

**Reality of this repo atm:** A collection of scripts and notebooks trying to get started with the research buddy.

**Current focus:** Producing natural, generated answers to questions regarding long (research) articles.

**My HuggingFace:** https://huggingface.co/stefanbschneider

I'm just getting started, so feel free to suggest ideas and improvements, e.g., by opening an issue.
